To run the tests, this directory should contain the following files with
SHA-256 hashes:

3a19066882a2260345eb245a0005153056ef63c5d2b0069d7ba3c4d3496f7c72  sqlite3_x64.dll

These files are in the public domain and can be obtained from the [SQLite
version 3.10.2 UAP package](https://www.sqlite.org/2016/sqlite-uap-3100200.vsix).
This is actually a ZIP file. Look in the `Redist/Retail` directory.
